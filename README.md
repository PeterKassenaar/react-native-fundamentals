Every folder is a small mini project, highlighting the features in that module. This is not a monorepo.

- `cd` to the folder you want to explore.
- type `npm install` to install dependencies.
- type `npm start` or `npx expo start` to start the project.
- Scan the QR-code in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app to load on your device.
   - Type `a` to run on Android, or `r` to reload the app. 

These projects use the `Expo Go app`. More info:
